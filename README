1) Synopsis
-----------

wavemon is a wireless device monitoring application that allows you to watch
signal and noise levels, packet statistics, device configuration and network
parameters of your wireless network hardware. It *should* work (though with
varying features) with all devices supported by the Linux wireless kernel
extensions by Jean Tourrilhes.

See the man page for an in-depth description of operation and configuration.


2) Where to obtain
------------------
You can always find the latest version at:

	http://eden-feed.erg.abdn.ac.uk/wavemon

Please check this page for updates and for further information.
wavemon is distributed under the GPLv3, refer to the file COPYING.


3) How to build
---------------
wavemon uses autoconf, so that in most cases you can simply run

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

to build and install the package. Type 'make uninstall' if not happy.
Refer to the file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.

To grant users access to restricted networking operations (e.g. reading WEP
keys or performing scan operations), use additionally

	sudo make install-suid-root

If you have changed some of the autoconf files or use a git version, run
	./config/bootstrap
(requires a recent installation of 'autotools').
